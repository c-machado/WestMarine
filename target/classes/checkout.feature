Feature: Checkout
  As a guest user I want to be able to do a checkout so I can purchase items

  Background:
    Given I am at "home" page
    And I search for "boat shoes"
    And I choose a product I want to buy

    Scenario: Purchase items

      #When I add the item to the Shopping cart
      #And I choose the delivery method
      #And I fill out the payment method form
      #And I Submit the order
      #Then I should see a successful purchase message
